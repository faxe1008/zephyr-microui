      Enable the immediate-mode animation subsystem for MicroUI. This provides
      a lightweight framework for animating values with various easing functions.
      Animation state is cached internally using IDs, following the immediate-mode
      paradigm. Unused animations are automatically garbage collected.

      Set the maximum number of animation states that can be cached.
      Each animation slot uses approximately 32 bytes of RAM.
      Animations not accessed for a number of frames are automatically
      evicted to make room for new ones.
